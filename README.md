Machine learning on graphs has become an important
and ubiquitous task with a wide range of applications. With an
advancement in the field of artificial intelligence and machine
learning, analysis and research on graphs have been receiving
more and more attention because of the great expressive power
of the graph. The motivation for graph neural network goes back
to convolutional neural network. CNNs have the ability to
capture spatial information and compose them to construct
highly expressive representations, which led to breakthroughs in
almost all machine learning areas and started the new era of
deep learning. However, CNNâ€™s can only operate on regular
Euclidean data like images and text while these data structures
can be regarded as instances of graphs. Also, unlike standard
neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can
represent information from its neighbourhood with arbitrary
depth. This project aims to provide an introduction to graph
convolutional network using Deep Graph Library, a python
package dedicated to deep learning on graphs. I present a series
of tutorials which I developed to help anyone new to Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN). The tutorials explain the
following concepts in detail: introduction to pytorch, followed by
creation of simple graphs using DGL and model implementation
and finally implementation of GCN using Cora dataset.
